              Congratulations Dr. Rajpal, on the good work! We first came to you
              with our child with autism. We were reassured by your calm and
              confident approach, that the child would progress developmentally.
              We had come all the way from Siliguri and our visit was definitely
              worth it. The turning point in our son’s life was when after
              following your treatment protocol for just 3 months , he spoke his
              first word. There has been no looking back since then. You have
              been extremely supportive in terms of guidance by responding to
              our queries, by phone and mail. I cannot express the gratitude we
              feel as our 4 year old starts preschool on Monday. Wishing you the
              very best.
            </p>

              Dr. Rajpal is an epitome of professionalism and empathy. We first
              consulted her 2 years back at Paras Hospital. Our child was very
              difficult to engage, not able to concentrate on either work or
              play. He had strange behaviours like head banging, teeth grinding
              and hitting. We were very worried. Even after our first meeting,
              Dr. Rajpal gave us confident that he would improve. He has been on
              medication and sensory integration therapy for past 6 months. We
              see a remarkable improvement. We are very grateful to Madam.

            <p>
              Two years ago when we came to Max Hospital to you with our
              daughter, we were really demoralized when we were faced with our
              daughter’s condition but you gave us enough confidence in our
              first meeting to put in the required efforts to get her treated.
              She has made fantastic progress and we have been getting a lot of
              appreciation from the school/teachers with zero complaints. Thanks
              to your expert counselling sessions which have helped us to emerge
              from hard times.<br />
              We wish you all the best and hope lots of other kids can benefit
              from your expertise and lead a much-much better life. We (parents)
              are working with Dr Radha from last one month on some development
              concerns faced by our son. We feel very lucky and fortunate that
              our son is under expert guidance of Dr. Radha.
              <span class="extra">
                We learned many parenting techniques in one - one sessions with
                Dr Radha, which really help in our child overall growth and
                development. The methodoloy and technique used is modern, simple
                and effective. The growth and development that we have seen in
                our child in last one month is nothing less then miracle.we are
                very much confident and in positive mind frame that our child
                will recover soon under expert guidance and mentor ship of Dr
                Radha and we hope our tough days ends soon.Thanks for all help.

              Dr. Rajpal is highly competent in diagnosing problem areas as well
              as empathetic to challenges faced by parents, her tendering
              approach to therapies greatly helped build a trusted relationship
              with our child. Overall we really feel assured on positive
              improvements with her advisories and treatment cycle. <br />
              We have been working with Dr.Radha Rajpal for some development
              concerns faced by our son since the past few months. Dr. Radha's
              strategies have been simple yet effective. She also does not
              believe in labels and rather focuses on issues at hand. Her
              approach is focused on practical things like integration into
              school rather than looking at what is 'normal' or time bound
              milestones. When it comes to our children more often than not
              parents are emotional and Dr.Rajpal has been a seasoned
              professional as well as a guide. <br />
              <span class="extra">
                One of her most valuable advice has been that parents are the
                most 'empowered' to help their child. While we have our
                difficult days (who doesn't) overall our son is moving in a
                positive direction. At times we across situations where words
                really run short in expressing the heartfelt gratitude for the
                efforts put in rather it will be apt for us to say “Efforts
                can’t be measured only with words but with act’s”. Your efforts
                , guidance and perfect line of treatment has transformed our
                child from being a child who was suffering from expressive
                speech delay to someone who has won the first prize in rhyme
                recitation at school</span
