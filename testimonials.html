              Dr Rajpal is highly competent in diagnosing problem areas as well
              as empathetic to challenges faced by parents, her tendering
              approach to therapies greatly helped build a trusted relationship
              with our child. Overall we really feel assured on positive
              improvements with her advisories and treatment cycle. <br />
              We have been working with Dr.Radha Rajpal for some development
              concerns faced by our son since the past few months. Dr. Radha's
              strategies have been simple yet effective. She also does not
              believe in labels and rather focuses on issues at hand. Her
              approach is focused on practical things like integration into
              school rather than looking at what is 'normal' or time bound
              milestones. When it comes to our children more often than not
              parents are emotional and Dr.Rajpal has been a seasoned
              professional as well as a guide. <br />
              One of her most valuable advice has been that parents are the most
              'empowered' to help their child. While we have our difficult days
              (who doesn't) overall our son is moving in a positive direction.
              At times we across situations where words really run short in
              expressing the heartfelt gratitude for the efforts put in rather
              it will be apt for us to say “Efforts can’t be measured only with
              words but with act’s”. Your efforts , guidance and perfect line of
              treatment has transformed our child from being a child who was
              suffering from expressive speech delay to someone who has won the
              first prize in rhyme recitation at school

              Two years ago when we came to Max Hospital to you with our
              daughter, we were really demoralized when we were faced with our
              daughter’s condition but you gave us enough confidence in our
              first meeting to put in the required efforts to get her treated.
              She has made fantastic progress and we have been getting a lot of
              appreciation from the school/teachers with zero complaints. Thanks
              to your expert counselling sessions which have helped us to emerge
              from hard times.<br />
              We wish you all the best and hope lots of other kids can benefit
              from your expertise and lead a much-much better life. We (parents)
              are working with Dr Radha from last one month on some development
              concerns faced by our son. we feel very lucky and fortunate that
              our son is under expert guidance of Dr Radha. We learned many
              parenting techniques in one - one sessions with Dr Radha, which
              really help in our child overall growth and development.The
              methodoloy and technique used is modern,simple and effective. The
              growth and development that we have seen in our child in last one
              month is nothing less then miracle.we are very much confident and
              in positive mind frame that our child will recover soon under
              expert guidance and mentor ship of Dr Radha and we hope our tough
              days ends soon.Thanks for all help.

              Congratulations Dr Rajpal,on the good work! We first came to you
              with our child with autism.We were reassured by your calm and
              confident approach,that the child would progress
              developmentally.We had come all the way from Siliguri and our
              visit was definitely worth it.The turning point in our son’s life
              was when after following your treatment protocol for just 3 months
              ,he spoke his first word.There has been no looking back since
              then.You have been extremely supportive in terms of guidance by
              responding to our queries,by phone and mail. I cannot express the
              gratitude we feel as our 4 year old starts preschool on
              Monday.Wishing you the very best.

              Dr Rajpal is an epitome of professionalism and empathy.We first
              consulted her 2 years back at Paras Hospital.Our child was very
              difficult to engage,not able to concentrate on either work or
              play.He had strange behaviours like head banging,teeth grinding
              and hitting.We were very worried.Even after our first meeting,Dr
              Rajpal gave us confident that he would improve.He has been on
              medication and sensory integration therapy for past 6 months.We
              see a remarkable improvement .We are very grateful to Madam.
